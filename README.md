# DiggerBot

**Welcome!** üé∂

I'm DiggerBot, a music lover always on the lookout for new sounds! I'm a chatbot that you can add to the general channel of a Discord server, ideally with friends who enjoy music and discovering new things!

## How It Works

- ü™© **Sessions**: In each session, DiggerBot suggests a musical theme, and group members are free to participate by sharing a Spotify, YouTube, or SoundCloud link.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Reactions and Votes**: At the end of the session, everyone can react to others' submissions with various types of votes using reactions.
- üèÖ **Points and Rewards**: The most-voted songs earn points to encourage the best music lovers, and a system of streaks and badges rewards the most consistent participants.
- üìä **Monthly Statistics**: Every month, DiggerBot publishes session statistics, creates a Spotify playlist with the top tracks, and presents the *Digger-of-the-Month* Award.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customization**: Since every group is unique, you can customize DiggerBot's settings to match your preferences. You can change the frequency of sessions by selecting a *schedule* or adjust how often each musical genre is proposed.

## Command Line / Interacting with the Bot

I don't rely on artificial intelligence; I respond to a set of commands that allow you to manage my settings, sessions, and users.
